* [View the user presence table in DynamoDB](#view-the-user-presence-table-in-dynamodb "Goes to the View the user presence table in DynamoDB section")

### Clone the repository that contains the project files

1. Clone the [aws-eventbridge-user-presence-update-blueprint](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/aws-eventbridge-user-presence-update-blueprint "Opens the aws-eventbridge-user-presence-update-blueprint") repository from GitHub to your local environment.

### Enable the Amazon EventBridge Source integration in your Genesys Cloud organization

1. In Genesys Cloud, install an Amazon EventBridge Source integration. For more information, see [Install Amazon EventBridge integration from Genesys AppFoundry](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=228013 "Goes to the Install Amazon EventBridge integration from Genesys AppFoundry article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

2. Configure the integration with the following settings:
  * **AWS Account ID**: Your AWS account ID
  * **AWS Account region**: Your [AWS account region](/api/rest/ "Goes to the Platform API page in the Genesys Cloud Developer Center")
  * **Event Source Suffix**: Your preferred suffix that identifies the source of the events
  * **Topic Filtering**: Select `v2.audits.entitytype.{id}.entityid.{id}`. This value corresponds to the event action on the AWS Lambda function.

    ![Topic filtering](images/topic-filtering.png "Topic filtering selection")

For more information, see [Configure the Amazon EventBridge integration](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=228016 "Goes to the Configure the Amazon EventBridge integration article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

### Configure your EventBridge Software as a Service (SaaS) integration

1. In your AWS account, configure your [EventBridge software as a service (SaaS)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home?region=us-east-1#/partners "Opens your AWS management console") integration.
2. Make a note of the event source name (for example, `aws.partner/example.com/1234567890/test-event-source`).
3. Before proceeding to the next step, verify that your event source is listed as **Pending**.

### Edit the TypeScript config file

:::primary
**Note**: This is necessary only if you want to use the TypeScript Lambda. If you do not want to use the TypeScript Lambda, feel free to remove the source code of either Lambda function and remove the references to it from the template.yaml file. Then, skip to the section, [Build and deploy the application](#build-and-deploy-the-application "Goes to the Build and deploy the application section")
:::

1. In your local copy of the [aws-eventbridge-user-presence-update-blueprint](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/aws-eventbridge-user-presence-update-blueprint "Opens the aws-eventbridge-user-presence-update-blueprint repository in GitHub") repository, go to **src** > **typescript** > **src**.

2. Edit the config.ts file to use these settings:

  * **region**: specify your AWS account region.
  * **table_name**: specify the value that corresponds with the `EventBridgeUserPresenceTable` value in the template.yaml file.  

### Build and deploy the application

You must build the application before you deploy it. The SAM CLI resolves the dependencies of both Lambda functions, builds them, and stores the artifacts in a directory named `.aws-sam`.  

1. To build the application, from the repo root, run the following command:

  ```
  sam build
  ```

2. Deploy the application. The following command will use CloudFormation to create the necessary resources for this application (roles, Lambdas, DynamoDB table, and so on).

:::primary
**Note**: This command creates resources in your AWS account and incurs costs. You must be authenticated to use the CLI before running the following command.
:::

  ```
  sam deploy --guided
  ```

3. When you are prompted, choose an appropriate stack name.  

4. Verify that the `EventSourceName` parameter contains the event source name that you noted in the [Configure your EventBridge software as a service (SaaS) integration](#configure-your-eventbridge-software-as-a-service-saas-integration "Goes to the Configure your EventBridge software as a service (SaaS) integration section") step.

### Trigger a user presence update

1. In the Genesys Cloud organization that is associated with your Amazon EventBridge Source integration, update the presence of a user. For more information, see [Agent presence, status, and activity indicators](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=64488 "Goes to the Agent presence, status, and activity indicators") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

### View the user presence table in DynamoDB

1. In the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ "Opens the AWS Console"), from the **Services** menu, open the DynamoDB service.

2. In the **Tables** section, search for `eb_user_presence`.

3. Select the eb_user_presence table and verify that the User Presence entry has the correct values for `user_id`, `updated_on` and `presence`.

## Run locally

For debugging purposes, you can run the Python and TypeScript functions for this solution locally.  

### Run locally using the TypeScript functions

1. Log a user presence update event to CloudWatch and save the contents to the `events/UserPresenceChange.json` file.  

2. Install the dependencies from the `src/typescript` folder:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

3. From the root folder of the blueprint repository, run the following command:

  ```
  ./run_local.sh node
  ```

### Run locally using the Python functions

1. Log a user presence update event to CloudWatch and save the contents to the `events/UserPresenceChange.json` file.  

2. Install the dependencies from the  `src/python` folder:  

  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Execute the following command:

  ```
  /.run_local.sh python
  ```

### Run locally using the SAM CLI

To run the Lambdas locally and imitate the AWS Lambda environment, use the following commands.

Python:
```
sam local invoke EventBridgeFunctionPython --event ./events/OAuthClientDelete.json
```

TypeScript:
```
sam local invoke EventBridgeFunctionNode --event ./events/OAuthClientDelete.json
```
